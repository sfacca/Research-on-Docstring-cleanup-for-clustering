# Research on Docstring cleanup for clustering
 
 This repository contains Julia code written to prepare a docstrings => clustering pipeline to investigate what kind of document pre-processing help obtain better clustering.

 We investigate quality of various available components of three parts:

 * pre-preocessing
 * tokenization
 * word filtering
 
 We will use the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the samples, cluster validation statistics will be the following:

 * silhouette score
 * mean distortion
 * dunn index
